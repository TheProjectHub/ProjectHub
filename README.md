## ProjectHub

A platform for students and young professionals to find projects to join that suit their preferences. From field (Healthcare/Social Media/Retail) to medium (web app, desktop app, robotics, sales tactics, services, etc.) to age range to time commitment; a user can find the perfect project for them. The site has two main functions: a search feature and project posting. The prior allows a user to find the perfect project for them using a variety of filters. The latter allows a group or individual to find others to join their project. On top of aiding in the process of finding projects or new members for pre existing projects, the platform incentivizes users to create amazing projects through a monthly competition. This competition is not only a chance for users to showcase their incredible work, but also to win a range of amazing prizes from internships/job offers to cold, hard cash depending on the sponsor.
